# PetCare Fund

## 📌 Project Description

PetCare Fund is a full-stack web application designed to help pet owners raise funds for their pets' medical treatments. The platform enables **pet owners** to register their pets, create treatment requests, and upload health records, while **administrators** can verify requests and manage the system efficiently. Donors and users can view treatment requests and contribute towards the medical costs of the pets.

The project is built using **Spring Boot (backend)** and a **Bootstrap/jQuery frontend**, with **JWT authentication** for secure access.
